In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
***

     I plan on writing Swift in Xcode and using the iOS developer tools to create an iPhone app. Currently I plan on making a brick breaker game, but I might create my own (relatively simple) game instead if inspiration strikes. 

***
In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect.  And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project.  I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

     I will implement an iPhone app and code some sort of simple game. 

***
In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project.  I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
***

     I think that I can create a game of my own that will be somewhat more complicated than brick breaker and which will have menus and decent graphics 

***
In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project.  I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

     I would hope to find a way to store, update, and access all-time high scores in the app
