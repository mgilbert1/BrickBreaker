BrickBreaker for iOS
Matt Gilbert
CS50 Final Project 2017


    This project should initially be imported into Xcode, either on a Mac or an OSX virtual machine on Windows. Use “command R” to run the project. It is optimized to run on the iPhone 7 simulator (because I have an iPhone 7 and I wanted to be able to test the program), but it should be possible to run it on any iPhone simulator, but not an iPad simulator. If you are running it on an iPhone simulator, use the mouse as your finger and hold and click to press down. To run or download this app on an iPhone, plug the phone into the computer and select your phone in the bar next to the play and stop buttons in the top left corner. You may have to go into general settings, then profiles and allow apps from “matt.b.gilbert@comcast.net” to be installed. I’m not sure if this will be necessary on another computer, or if it will ask for permission from the developer on your computer. For more information, see this link: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/LaunchingYourApponDevices/LaunchingYourApponDevices.html I know this is not exactly in the spirit of the “README” file, but I just want to make sure it is possible to run my app.
    If you run into an error on the iPhone app (such as the ball moving off the screen), close out of the app and reopen it. Otherwise, the game automatically restarts after each loss.

    Rules of BrickBreaker:
    Bounce the ball off of the paddle into the bricks to destroy them. Move the paddle side to side by dragging with your finger or tapping. The bricks will descend and new bricks will be added as time passes. The bricks will descend and be added more often as time passes, and the ball will move faster as time passes. Don’t let the ball dip below the paddle and don’t let the bricks drop to the level of the paddle. If either occurs, the game ends. You get points for hitting bricks with the ball, and you will get more points the more time has passed. Try to get as many points as possible.

        I used Google Drawings and Preview to make the images I use in this program.
